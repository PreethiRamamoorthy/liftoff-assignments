## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The app we are planning to create is a hospital administration app where in we will use it for creating new patients, booking an appointment for new as well as existing patients, editing an appointment, deleting an appointment and viewing all the details. This app can be viewed as a one stop place for handling and viewing all the appointments. 

The online platform that are being used in the hospitals are extensive with the multitude of informations related to patients, doctors, their visits, various procedures etc. It is extremely complex to develop such an exhaustive platform which will be used by so many users across locations/regions and that has connections to various other platforms, databases etc. All these details pertaining to the hospital in an dministrative point of view starts only with the patient's need to see the doctor. This process needs to be streamlined so that the subsequent processes are able to run smoothly. Hence we are working on this project that mainly focuses on the initial phase of any hospital administration process which includes adding new patients, booking appointments etc. It is extremely important to have a full medical history documented properly for all the patients right from the beginning.

### Features
1. Admin Login: Whenever an appointment is being booked by a admin or front desk personnel, it is extremely important that, that particular person has the right authentication to do make the appointment. Hence we will have our very forst feature for the admin personnel authentication.
2. Adding New patients: Even before an appointments are made, the details of that person should be present in the system. Hence we will have the add new patient feature to first include them in the hospital database. 
3. Creating/Editing/Deleting Appointments: Then we will use the feature for creating an appointment for the first time, editing them for any changes and then cancelling the appointments. 
4. View all/select: Next we will have the 'view all' feature or 'select particular details' feature to see the details that we have created previously. 

### Technologies
1. Java
2. SpringBoot
3. MySQL.
4. Hibernate.
5. ThymeLeaf Templates

### What I'll Have to Learn

Selecting a set of appointments on a particular date: This functionality needs to be learnt how to implement when we have a search functionality being used in this application. It is always important to make any app user friendly, easier and more readable to make it a success. Hence it is necessary to implement features that supports these aspects.
